# rl_path -- Finding TSP path on a colored image with reinforcement learning 

Still work in progress. The file [animation_rl.py](https://github.com/denisergashbaev/rl_path/blob/master/animation_rl.py)
 visualizes a path that a trained DQN-agent has found to fill out number O. 
![Number 0](https://github.com/denisergashbaev/rl_path/blob/master/number0_path.gif "Number 0")

The original DQN implementation is based on [rl_args_implementation](https://github.com/MaximilienLC/rl_algs_implementation)
